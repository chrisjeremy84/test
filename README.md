# Project Overview

This is a test project for Typescript use with Reactjs. The following are the base features that are to be tested;
- Props √
- Functions √
- Events (References and more) √ - NEEDS MORE PRACTICE
- Asynchronous events
- Interfaces
- Hooks
- Classes
- Generics

Practices

- Use type annotations consistently: This will help to prevent errors and make code more readable.
- Use interfaces to define the structure of objects: This can help to ensure that objects are compatible with each other.
- Use classes when appropriate: Classes can offer some additional features, such as type safety and inheritance.
- Use generics when appropriate: Generics can be used to create code that can work with different types of data.
